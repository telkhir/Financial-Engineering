# Financial-Engineering

this notebook is about using finanacial engineering technics to price and hedge in the commodities market (Gold, Copper, Grains, metals ... ), it contain these parts:

1. Pricing the *spot price* of a commodity using the *Schwartz one factor model*, with computation of the convenience yeild

2. Pricing the *Futures contracts* on the commodity with fixed Maturity, and analysing its Term Structures

3. Pricing of *Options prices* on those Futures

4. Hedging the short position of the option selles using a *delta hedge strategy*, and comparing it to a lasy strategy (putting money into a bank account and gaining interest rates on it)
